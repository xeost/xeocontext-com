# Prompt for Generating XeoContext Landing Page

Please act as an expert UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer. Create a stunning, high-converting landing page for **XeoContext**.

## Project Overview
XeoContext is a modern, lightweight visualization tool designed to be the "Source of Truth" for your software architecture. It unifies System Design documentation, API specifications, and Event-Driven architecture definitions into a single, beautiful interface.

## Design Vision
- **Aesthetic:** Minimalist, futuristic, and developer-centric. Think "Linear" or "Vercel" style.
- **Theme:** Dark mode first, with vibrant neon accents (blue/purple gradients) to signify "context" and "connection".
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif fonts (Inter or similar).

## Key Sections to Include

### 1. Hero Section
- **Headline:** "Your Architecture. Unified." or "The Modern Home for System Design."
- **Subheadline:** "Visualize Markdown, OpenAPI, and AsyncAPI in one place. The ultimate context viewer for Developers and AI Agents."
- **CTA Buttons:** "Get Started" (Primary), "View Demo" (Secondary, Outline).
- **Visual:** A sleek mockup showing the XeoContext interface with the three tabs (System Design, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI) visible.

### 2. The Problem vs. The Solution
- **Problem:** Scattered documentation. System design in Wiki, API specs in SwaggerHub, Event definitions in obscure text files.
- **Solution:** XeoContext. One config file. One Docker container. One coherent view.

### 3. Core Features (Grid Layout)
- **Multi-Format Support:** First-class rendering for Markdown (with Mermaid diagrams), OpenAPI (Swagger UI), and AsyncAPI.
- **Static & Fast:** Built with Next.js Static Export. Zero backend logic. Blazing fast load times.
- **Docker Ready:** Drop a volume with your content into the container, and you're live. No rebuilds required.
- **AI-Native:** Designed to serve as the structured context source for AI Coding Agents.
- **Theme Awareness:** Built-in Light, Dark, and System modes with lucid transitions.

### 4. How It Works (3 Steps)
1.  **Define:** Write your documentation (Markdown, YAML).
2.  **Configure:** Create a simple `xeocontext.config.json` linking your files.
3.  **Deploy:** Run the Docker container or host purely static strings.

### 5. Technical Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- Swagger UI & AsyncAPI React
- Lucide React Icons

### 6. Footer
