# Structure & Organization

## Why Domain-Driven Structure?
Organizing your design content by **Domain** (e.g., `identity`, `payments`) rather than by file type is crucial for effective AI-assisted development. This approach creates clear **Context Boundaries**, allowing you to feed an AI agent the complete "truth" about a specific domain—its business logic (Markdown), API contracts (OpenAPI), and events (AsyncAPI)—without distracting noise.

For a deeper dive into this philosophy, read [Harmonizing AI Code Generation with Centralized System Design](https://xeost.com/blog/centralizing-system-design).

## Directory Structure
The content directory follows a strict separation between **Global Architecture** and **Bounded Contexts (Domains)**.

**1. Root Configuration**
- `xeocontext.config.json`: [MANDATORY] The central navigation and metadata map for the viewer.

**2. The "Global" Directory (`/global`)**
Defines the laws of the system and cross-cutting concerns.
- **Gateway (`/global/gateway`)**: Contains the **Master Root** files (`openapi.yaml`, `asyncapi.yaml`). These files aggregate endpoints and channels from all domains to provide a unified "System View".
- **ADRs (`/global/adrs`)**: Architecture Decision Records explaining *why* decisions were made.
- **Standards (`/global/standards`)**: Naming conventions, error handling, etc.

**3. Domain Modules (`/domains`)**
Each folder represents a specific business capability (e.g., `identity`, `payments`).
- **Co-location**: Markdown, OpenAPI, and AsyncAPI specs reside together.
- **Fragmented Architecture**: Actual definitions (Schemas, Paths) should live in `components/` subfolders and be aggregated by the domain's root `openapi.yaml`.

## Content Validation
It is recommended to validate your spec files before committing changes to ensure the viewer renders them correctly.

### OpenAPI Validation
You can use [Redocly CLI](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/) to lint and bundle your OpenAPI definitions.

```bash
# Lint the main gateway file (and all its references)
pnpm --package=@redocly/cli dlx redocly lint content/global/gateway/openapi.yaml

# Lint a specific domain file
pnpm --package=@redocly/cli dlx redocly lint content/domains/identity/components/paths/auth_login.yaml
```

### AsyncAPI Validation
You can use [AsyncAPI CLI](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tools/cli) to validate your AsyncAPI definitions.

```bash
# Validate the main gateway file
pnpm dlx @asyncapi/cli validate content/global/gateway/asyncapi.yaml
```
