# Introduction

XeoContext is a modern "System Design" visualization tool. It is designed to be a lightweight, self-contained viewer for:

- **System Design documents**: Markdown files with Mermaid diagram support.
- **OpenAPI definitions**: visualized using Swagger UI.
- **AsyncAPI definitions**: visualized using AsyncAPI React component.

XeoContext is designed to be deployed as a Docker container with a read-only volume mounted to provide the content.

## Features

### Core Viewers
- **System Design Viewer**:
  - Renders Markdown documents with GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).
  - **Mermaid Diagrams**: Native support for Flowcharts, Sequence diagrams, C4 diagrams, classes, and more.
  - **Smart Navigation**: Recursive sidebar navigation with support for nested items.
  - **SEO Optimized**: dynamic document title and description updates based on frontmatter.
- **OpenAPI Viewer**:
  - Interactive REST API documentation using a custom implementation of **Swagger UI**.
  - **Dark Mode Support**: Fully customized theme that adapts to the application's dark mode.
  - **Server-Side Dereferencing**: Resolves all `$ref` pointers (internal and external) to ensure stability.
- **AsyncAPI Viewer**:
  - Event-Driven Architecture visualization using the AsyncAPI React component.
  - Supports dereferencing of AsyncAPI schemas from external URLs.

### Architecture & Experience
- **Theme Support**: Seamless switching between Light, Dark, and System modes.
- **Dynamic Content**: Content is decoupled from code. Loads configuration and documentation from local files or Git repositories.
- **Docker Ready**:
  - Production-optimized image (`xeost/xeocontext:latest`).
  - Live-reload image for development (`xeost/xeocontext-live-reload:latest`).
- **Customizable Deployment**: Built-in scripts (`setup-content`) to easily deploy your own instance to Vercel or other platforms, syncing content from your own repository.
- **Modern Stack**: Built with Next.js 16 (App Router) and Turbopack.

## AI Integration

This repository is designed to be the "Source of Truth" for system design. The `content` directory is intended to be read by AI Coding Agents (via MCP Servers or direct access) to scaffold and maintain other repositories based on the designs defined here. But from a clean system design content repository, see [`examples/markdown-openapi-asyncapi`](https://github.com/xeost/xeocontext/tree/main/examples/markdown-openapi-asyncapi) for a quickstart.
