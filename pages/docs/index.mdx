# Welcome to XeoContext

**XeoContext** is a modern, unified documentation viewer designed to bridge the gap between high-level system design and low-level API specifications. It provides a seamless interface to visualize your Markdown-based architecture docs, OpenApi REST definitions, and AsyncAPI event-driven schemas all in one place.

## Core Features

- **Unified View:** Switch effortlessly between textual System Design documentation and interactive API references.
- **System Design:** Render rich Markdown with support for **Mermaid diagrams**, inline code highlighting, and auto-generated Tables of Contents.
- **OpenAPI Integration:** Embedded Swagger UI to visualize and test your REST API endpoints.
- **AsyncAPI Integration:** Native rendering for Event-Driven Architectures (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.).
- **Zero-Build Deployment:** XeoContext is designed as a static container. You bring your content; we provide the viewer. No need to rebuild the application to update documentation.
- **Responsive & Themed:** Fully responsive design with automatic Dark/Light mode support.

## Why XeoContext?

Documentation often lives in silos: Confluence for design, SwaggerHub for REST, and obscure text files for events. XeoContext centralizes these technical artifacts, making it easier for developers, architects, and stakeholders to understand the complete context of a system.
